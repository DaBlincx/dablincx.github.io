# my website yay

i like coding (this is a lie) and i definitely like javascript ðŸ˜€

if u want to run this website locally for whatever reason, just run `npm install` and then `npm start` and it should work

to export the website to actual static html, run `npm run export` and it will be in the `out` folder
